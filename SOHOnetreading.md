##What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous?
 Its fame stems from being one of the earliest consumer-grade routers that supported custom firmware, notably the open-source firmware projects like DD-WRT, OpenWRT, and Tomato. This feature allowed users to customize and expand the router's capabilities beyond the manufacturer's specifications, making it popular among tech enthusiasts, hobbyists, and professionals.
##Given it’s age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL?
 People continue to buy the WRT54GL for several reasons:

Its reliability: Despite being an older model, it's known for its stability and durability.
Custom firmware support: Enthusiasts and those seeking specific functionalities prefer this router due to its ability to run various custom firmware options.
Cost-effectiveness: It's often available at lower prices compared to newer models, making it an attractive option for those on a budget or those seeking a basic router for specific purposes.
##What does the “WRT54GL” stand for in the name?
In the name, "WRT" stands for "Wireless RouTer," "54" denotes the maximum wireless data transfer speed of 54 Mbps in the 802.11g standard, and "GL" indicates Linux-based firmware.
##What did Linksys sell before routers?
Before routers, Linksys primarily sold networking equipment such as Ethernet hubs, switches, and network cards.
##When did Linksys preview their first consumer router?
Linksys previewed its first consumer router, the BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Router, in 1999.
##Who suggested to name it a “router”?
The term "router" to describe networking devices directing internet traffic originated from the collaboration of research institutions and individuals involved in the development of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet.
##What happened when Cisco replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform?
When Cisco, the parent company of Linksys at the time, replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform in later models of the WRT54G series, it received backlash from the open-source community. The switch restricted the ability to modify and customize the firmware, reducing the device's appeal to enthusiasts who valued the open-source nature of the original firmware.
##Why doesn’t the WRT54GL model need to be modified to abide by the new FCC rules?
The WRT54GL model doesn't require modification to comply with FCC rules because it was initially designed to allow users to load their firmware without violating regulatory guidelines. Its hardware was intentionally kept open, facilitating the installation of third-party firmware.
##Does the WRT54GL model still get updates from Linksys?
As of my last update in January 2022, Linksys had stopped providing official firmware updates for the WRT54GL for a considerable time. However, the open-source community continued to support the device through custom firmware releases like DD-WRT, OpenWRT, and Tomato, providing updates and patches independently.
